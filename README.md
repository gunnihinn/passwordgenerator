# Password generator

This password generates a password from a random selection of dictionary words
that contains lower- and upper-case letters and a number.

This program neither endorses regular use of such passwords, nor security
policies that make its existence necessary. What you really want is a
[password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager).

## Installation

Use the install script:

    $ ./install

or rename the script and copy it to a directory in your `$PATH`. For example:

    $ install main.pl $HOME/.local/bin/passwordgenerator
